Patterns You May Need
=======

Other patterns, not just the one your framework provides, are quite useful. Especially as your app gets bigger.

Here are some (one so far) patterns that you may need.

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

    gem 'pymn'

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install pymn
